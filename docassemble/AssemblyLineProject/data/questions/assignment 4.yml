  Using an introduction screen is a good idea. It helps your
  user understand what the tool can and cannot do.
  Use the specifier field for a screen that doesn't do anything
  except display a continue button.

    ## The charges against Martin Luther King Jr. must be dropped
    Dear Prosecutor,
    I am writing to you concerning the prosecution of Martin Luther King Jr., who is currently incarcerated in the Birmingham Jail.
    Dr. King was arrested as a non-violent participant in protests against segregation. His arrest is unfair and in violation of international law.
    ${custom_paragraph}
    In conclusion, I ask you to immediately release Dr. King.
    Yours sincerely,
